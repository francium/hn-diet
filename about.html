      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        This project was inspired by Paul Houle's
        <a href="http://ontology2.com/essays/HackerNewsForHackers/">Hacker News for Hackers article.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        The current filter is based on a blacklist of phrases and domains. Each
        lines (of the text area on the web page) is used to filter the story titles
        or domain if prefixed with 'site:'.
      </p>

      <p>
        Example of a blacklist:

        <pre>
          site:aws.amazon.com
          site:bbc.com
          site:bloomberg.com
          site:nytimes.com
          site:qz.com
          site:reuters.com
          site:techcrunch.com
          site:theatlantic.com
          site:theverge.com
          site:www.economist.com
          site:www.theguardian.com
          site:www.vox.com
          site:www.washingtonpost.com
          site:zdnet.com
          bitcoin
          housing market
          (IOT.*security)|(security.*IOT)
          apple
          instagram
          iphone
          is hiring
        </pre>

        As you can see, it does support regular expressions, so you have some
        freedom to play around and create somewhat complex patterns to match on.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>

      <p>
        This site uses the Hacker News Firebase API to get the data. This site
        is served directly from GitHub Pages. You are welcome, and encouraged,
        to see the source code on <a href="https://github.com/francium/hn-diet">github/francium/hn-diet</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        No information is stored by this website directly. There maybe
        information that GitHub or Firebase store as a consequence of using
        their services -- such as when you request this page from GitHub Pages
        and when this site loads data using the Firebase Hacker News API. For
        information stored by Github or Firebase, please review their
        respective privacy policies.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an experiment, and to get a sense of the number of people making use
        of this website, an image will be loaded from the GitHub repo every
        time the main page of this website is loaded. This information will be
        stored on the GitHub repo for this website. This is done strictly to
        get a rough estimate of the popularity of this website only, and I will
        not have access to any specific information.
      </p>

      <P>
        Being an experiment, I do not know if it will actually work.
      </P>

      <p>
        This method of collecting basic analytic data was chosen over services
        like Google Analytics to better respect user privacy, and not force
        users to expose their information to an additional party.
